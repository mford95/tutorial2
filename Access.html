          When writing the code for my marmalade website I took some steps to in order to bring it to a simple level of accessibility. Starting off with setting the language to English to make it somewhat compatible with voice software such as JAWS. Making sure along the way using the necessary tags such as NAV to have it able to read the navigation bar.

            In terms of actual site design and color palate I felt I was restrained by time to put in necessary research in order to have it to cater to people with color blindness. I did however try to make the font at a reasonable size and clear buttons with foreground and background coloring being not too similar.

            I would have liked to put more research into creating a more widely accessible level for the website to cater to a wider audience although that would have been a challenge to include many differing levels of accessibility for those who need to use the features. 
            Going forward if I was to develop this website to a higher standard, I would look into how colors would affect the general design of the website to cater to people with color blindness. Looking into the use of specific code for compatibility of other software to be used with the website to aid people in viewing the information presented.
