        <p>
          For my home page layout i had deviated from the original wireframe, the reason for this is that it wasn't very user 
          friendly when navigating to each page. The new layout is built up of tiles of each page that is available to be viewed
          </p>
          <p>
          The reason for the tile layout was because of the growing page count on the home page, By using the tiles i can display each 
          individual page without having to scroll down the home page.
