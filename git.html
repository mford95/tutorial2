        <p>Git Is an industry standard open-source version control system.
          It is a tool that keeps track of changes done to code over the
          course of a project, giving you the ability to revert to a previous
          version of your code at any given time if you are required to do so.
          Git gives each project a repository, giving the project a basic
          timeline for each change.

   	      This leads to Git’s branching system, a tool that lets you work
          from the master code, ensuring that if anything were to go wrong
          with the changes made the master code will still be intact.
          This branching system is especially effective when used in collaboration
          with a team of developers. Git keeps a backlog of any changes made along
          with which contributor is associated with those changes, making it a
          reliable tool for collaborative projects.

 	        If a team of developers were to redesign a website and showcase a
          functioning prototype at short notice, then Git would be a tool used
          to streamline the process.
 	        Using Git’s branch system, the team of developers would be able to
          create their own branch from the master code, each to develop what
          they were tasked to do without completely ruining the existing code.
          With the branches being merged together when needed to create the final
          build for the project.
